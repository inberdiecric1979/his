When it comes to writing an academic paper, crafting a strong thesis statement is one of the most essential skills a student can develop.

## What is a Thesis Statement?

A **thesis statement** is a concise summary of the main point or claim of your essay, research paper, or other academic writing. It typically appears at the end of your introduction and outlines what the paper will discuss or argue. It acts as a roadmap for your readers, offering them a preview of what to expect.

But what exactly should your thesis statement do? This is where the concept of "argumentative" comes into play. The short answer is: **Yes, thesis statements often need to be argumentative**.

## Argumentative Thesis Statements: What You Need to Know

An argumentative thesis statement is designed to present an opinion or claim that others might dispute. It requires you to defend your position through logical reasoning, evidence, and analysis. For example, if you are writing a persuasive essay on climate change, your thesis statement might argue that "Immediate action is necessary to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment." This is a claim that requires support, and your paper will need to provide compelling evidence to back it up.

However, not all thesis statements are argumentative in nature. Some papers, such as informative or analytical essays, may require a **non-argumentative thesis** , which simply presents information without taking a stance. If you're unsure which type of thesis is right for your paper, our expert team can guide you through the process. Reach out for help now:

- **Making it too broad:** Your thesis statement should focus on a specific aspect of the topic, not an entire field of study.
- **Being overly argumentative:** While argumentative thesis statements are often necessary, don’t overdo it! Be sure to present a balanced and reasoned argument.
